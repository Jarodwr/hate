What is this?
- Trying to make a good base to create games, one thing that I find hard in love2d is switching scenes and making sure that objects don'tstick around longer than they need to
- Using this to learn how to structure my projects better
- Template with a whole load of tools/utilities that I will generally use in game development
- Everything in /library is written by other people
- Everything else is mine
